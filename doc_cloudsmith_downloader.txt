Cloudsmith Integration in Nebula Downloader
==================================================================
Documentation of the changes to support cloudsmith in nebula downloader

Features added:
Cloudsmith API: it uses cloudsmith API call to fetch the metadata and download files. 
                filtered it primarily with versions. service account slug name (e.g., haribo-habo-bun)
                and service account API token is needed to pass in the cli argument.

Board matching & Date matching: Using the selected repo metada, board matching and date matching is
                                done to ensure the correct file is being fetched. if the passed <branch>
                                includes "/" (e.g., 2022_r1/2024_00_00_04_00_00), it will download the file
                                with the specific date, else it will download the latest date version.

SHA256 verification: using the metadata fetched from cloudsmith API, autmatically verifies the download through
                     cross checking of SHA256.

### CLI example:


nebula show-log dl.bootfiles --board-name=<board-name> --source=cloudsmith --branch=<branch> 
--filetype=boot_partition --cloudsmith-token=<service-account API token> --service-user=<service-user slug-name>

Major changes in the code:
========================================================================
_get_files_boot_partition:
   - Accepts and uses `service_user` and `cloudsmith_token` for Cloudsmith downloads.
   - Checks if `source == "cloudsmith"` to trigger Cloudsmith-specific logic.
   - If `branch` contains "/", performs an exact date and board match.
   - If not, calls `_get_newest_cloudsmith_package` to select the newest dated version for the board.

_get_newest_cloudsmith_package:
    -strictly match the board name and the latest date when selecting the package.
    - Only considers packages where the board in the version string matches the requested board.

added conditional statements to skip artifactory methods when source == "cloudsmith"
